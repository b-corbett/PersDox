- Get Network+ exam prep bundle BY FEB 7 ( due 4/5 ) ( $576 ) ( https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network )

- Alcumus challenge!!!  ( challenge ends on 2/15 ) ( email on 1/2 )

- Mathbot Tester
  - REFACTOR: OverallResultsFile class, helper functions, custom_json
  - Any and all features and functions that are currently implemented should be applied to a web interface
  - Implement testing for problems that are initially unparseable; modify the problem and retest
    * this is to check if the problem has no solver, or the format was just unparseable for mathbot
    * report these tests somehow in overall results and/or in test.txt's
  - check "Goings-On" convo with William
  - Add to 'README.md' how to:
    1. what the errors mean 
    2. details about updating the files from Rob's repo (i'll have to manage this somehow)
