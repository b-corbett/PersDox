- Alcumus challenge  ( challenge ends on 2/15 ) ( email on 1/2 )

- Mathbot Tester
  - Tally up these three scenarios in overall_test_results.txt:
    1. Existing solver - output tagged - test failed
    2. Existing solver - output NOT tagged - test failed
    3. Non-existing solver...
  *** ^^^^ mathgenerator is innaccurate sometimes and can't be parsed by mathbot, so...
    - manually report in a file the generated problems that are unparseable by mathbot but are solved when changed 
            (ie "LCM of $7$ and $20=$" -> "LCM of 7 and 20").
    - implement testing for problems that are initially unparseable; modify the problem and retest
      * this is to check if the problem has no solver, or the format was just unparseable for mathbot
      * report these tests somehow in overall results and/or in test.txt's
    - check "Goings-On" convo with William
  - Add to 'README.md' how to:
    1. what the errors mean 

--- TODO-Reminders for the math API work are in my repo, but really it's in here more
