For current math solving testing & report
1/19
William: Did you fix that bug you were showing me last time?
	 Also im going to need access to your repository https://vcs.he.net/math-solver/math-site-solvers-brian.corbett/-/tree/math_solver_report and not
	    just for a temporary amount of time, please either move it to a repository under your own name so you can give me access yourself or tell tom
	    to not put a time restriction on it, if you have trouble let me know and ill talk to him about it
Me: Hey will, I made my own repository https://vcs.he.net/brian.corbett/mathbot_testing and i invited you to have maintainer permissions indefinitely. i've
    fixed all bugs associated with creating json tests and running the tests. I'm still working on the overall test results. I've had to refactor a couple of 
    times because the way I was trying to parse all the results was turning out to be spaghetti code. I've now got a plan to continue with the overall test 
    results. 
    a couple questions:
    so far im thinking pass/fail results for each category (basic_math, algebra, etc.) of problems (which i'm about halfway done with already), 
                   and pass/fail results for each problem specifically which are actually calculated in each problems' folder already, should I also show
		   those results in the overall test result file?
    are  you planning on using the math generator tester as soon as possible? 
    The tester itself and adding a test result file for each individual problem is working so that's usable. I just can't think of much else I can measure 
    for the overall results besides what is mentioned above, but what other metrics do you have in mind? you name it and I'll include it

Robert: The return code being 0 when 0 tests were found is the correct behavior as originally intended, but I agree it is a little confusing. I will move it to 2. I'm thinking of reserving 1 for "tests were found correctly, but failed" and 2 as a generic "something happened, and tests were not found/loaded correctly."
        ok, the latest commit to master should reflect those changes. Addition.json's question is just "2+2", which isn't tagged yet.

	service@service:~/mathbot_api_test$ python3 test.py addition.json -v
	WARNING:root:the string 'he-info' was not found in the html_solution returned by the mathbot API.
	ERROR:root:No tests were run. Either there were 0 tests found in test.json, or there was no HTML element tagged with an id starting with "he-info" in the API response's "html_solution" field.
	service@service:~/mathbot_api_test$ echo $?
	2
	we do have a full 255 error codes available to use, with around ~130 Linux-standard ones: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/constants/errnos.md
	If it would be helpful to have your program do something based on the specific return code you get back, I can implement more than just 0,1 and 2.

William: great so just to confirm you should have the tests in such a way that they can be batch tested so we can check the changes per problem on whether 
				 our solvers can solve/parse them in the future
Brian:   Right so essentially, someone should be able to create multiple json files relating to different problems and run them through the script all at 
				 once correct?
William: yup
				 for the python math problem generator specifically you might want to have a way to generate problems with it, turn those into the proper json 
				 format, and then be able to send those to the api
Brian:   alright sounds good. i'll start with the generator for now

ASKED TO BOB ON 1/2
well looks like I can run it now, i'm getting this error:
		Command '['info-tag/extract-tag.php', '-c', 'he-info']' returned non-zero exit status 127.
Any idea what this means? I've been trying to find out but haven't found anything useful i think
	ANSWER: run this command 'sudo apt install php php-dom php-mbstring'

CHATS - From William
Will: https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator this is the python library which has a function to generate example problems of a certain type based on a number which indicates the type of problem
Will: https://staging.mathanswered.com/ enter them here not sure if you have an account for the math site yet but you should make one
Will: theres about a 100 unique types or so listed on the github page, generate atleast one problem of each type and make a report of whether our mathbot can solve it or not

Will: cool the report looks good so far
Will: next thing would be to have another script to run each of the test problems with jasons api and put the results in another file
	and then i know bob mightve wrote a tool to make comparing the answers possible
Will: but for now you might want to reformat how you store the questions in solver_capability_tracker.txt so that you can read them again in 
  	python and query the api for each question
Me: gotcha, that's related to a question I had. the solver should be able to parse and solve the problems as they're asked in the python 
  	mathgenerator library right? like in word problem form?
Will: yeah mostly
	for the questions where you had to rewrite the problem a bit to get it to work, you can still list those in the file, and test each of 
 	them against the api
Will: but mostly you should just take the output of the mathgenerator and test that
Will: directly passing to the api

Setup
- robert.loth
the "Make Setup" script at https://vcs.he.net/robert.loth/make-setup should be much easier to use now, if anyone is still using 
  it. The old version is at tag v0.1 "git checkout v0.1" and the new version is at tag v0.2 "git checkout v0.2". Usage has changed, 
  the first and only argument is the <username> from <username>@he.net 

https://math.he.net/interact
https://math.he.net/mathbot

Math API
12/22, 11:41 (and after 12/22 is when talk of the API begins)
curl -v -F 'q=1+2+3+4'  https://math.he.net/mathbot

12/28, 
https://vcs.he.net/robert.loth/mathbot_api_test
https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser
robert.loth: ok, the api test script has a new url to reflect what it actually does. https://vcs.he.net/robert.loth/mathbot_api_test 
	It should be feature-complete at this point. Only installation step past what is already on the noc computers is "sudo apt install php php-dom php-mbstring"
  to deal with the php subprocess dependencies.
