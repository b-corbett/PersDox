CHATS - From William
Will: https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator this is the python library which has a function to generate example problems of a certain type based on a number which indicates the type of problem
Will: https://staging.mathanswered.com/ enter them here not sure if you have an account for the math site yet but you should make one
Will: theres about a 100 unique types or so listed on the github page, generate atleast one problem of each type and make a report of whether our mathbot can solve it or not

Will: cool the report looks good so far
Will: next thing would be to have another script to run each of the test problems with jasons api and put the results in another file
	and then i know bob mightve wrote a tool to make comparing the answers possible
Will: but for now you might want to reformat how you store the questions in solver_capability_tracker.txt so that you can read them again in 
  	python and query the api for each question
Me: gotcha, that's related to a question I had. the solver should be able to parse and solve the problems as they're asked in the python 
  	mathgenerator library right? like in word problem form?
Will: yeah mostly
	for the questions where you had to rewrite the problem a bit to get it to work, you can still list those in the file, and test each of 
 	them against the api
Will: but mostly you should just take the output of the mathgenerator and test that
Will: directly passing to the api

Setup
- robert.loth
the "Make Setup" script at https://vcs.he.net/robert.loth/make-setup should be much easier to use now, if anyone is still using 
  it. The old version is at tag v0.1 "git checkout v0.1" and the new version is at tag v0.2 "git checkout v0.2". Usage has changed, 
  the first and only argument is the <username> from <username>@he.net 

https://math.he.net/interact
https://math.he.net/mathbot

Math API
12/22, 11:41 (and after 12/22 is when talk of the API begins)
curl -v -F 'q=1+2+3+4'  https://math.he.net/mathbot

12/28, 
https://vcs.he.net/robert.loth/mathbot_api_test
https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser
robert.loth: ok, the api test script has a new url to reflect what it actually does. https://vcs.he.net/robert.loth/mathbot_api_test 
	It should be feature-complete at this point. Only installation step past what is already on the noc computers is "sudo apt install php php-dom php-mbstring"
  to deal with the php subprocess dependencies.
