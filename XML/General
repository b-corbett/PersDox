Syntax
- must contain one root element which is the parent of all other elements
- XML Prolog - optional, but must come first in the document
  * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
- all elements must have a closing tag
- white-space is preserved in XML

Elements
- empty elements can be closed with a self-closing tag
  * <element />
  * they can have attributes
- naming rules:
  * case-sensitive
  * must start with underscore or letter
  * cannot start with 'xml'
  * can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, periods
  * cannot contain spaces
- it is extensible, given that the program knows what it's looking for, adding information shouldn't break apps

Attributes
- some cons
  * one attribute cannot contain multiple values
  * cannot contain tree structure
  * not easily expandable
- metadata about the elements should be stored as attributes, data itself are elements

Namespaces
- name conflicts (<table> for html, user-defined <table> for xml) area voided using prefixes
  * html table: <h:table>       xml table: <f:table>
- prefixes need to be defined with a namespace
  * https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_namespaces.asp
  
XMLHttpRequest object (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_xmlhttprequest_send.asp)
- object used to request data from a web server
- allows you to
  * update web page without reloading it
  * request / receive data from a server after page has loaded
  * send data to server in the background
=================
// JavaScript syntax for using the object
var xmlhttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();           // create XMLHttpRequest object
xmlhttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {     // specify function to execute when status of object changes
  if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {       // when these are true, the response is ready
    document.getElementById("el_id").innerHTML = xmlhttpReq.responseText;    // common use
  }                                                                           // .responseXML returns as XML DOM
};
xmlhttpReq.open("GET", "filename.txt?t=" + Math.random(), true);   //open(method, url, async)
xmlhttpReq.send();
=================

Parser (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_parser.asp)
- for XML doc to be processed, must be loaded into an XML DOM
- all modern browsers have a built-in XML parser to convert into XML DOM
- XML DOM allows accessing XML elements just like HTML DOM

XPath
- defines parts of an XML doc
- uses path expressions to navigate
- contains lib of standard functions
- major elment in XSLT & XQuery (?)
- W3C recommendation

XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)
- transform XML doc into HTML doc
- can manipulate much of an XML document
  * uses XPath to find information in an XML doc
  
XQuery
- is to XML what SQL is to DB
=======
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book
where $x/price > 30
order by $x/title
return $x/title
=======
- uses XPath to navigate
- W3C recommendation

XLink 
- creates hyperlinks in XML docs
- W3C recommendation
- no browser support

XPointer
- allows links to point to parts of an XML doc
- uses XPath
- W3C recommendation
- no browser support

DTD - Document Type Definition
- defines structure and legal elements / attributes of an XML doc

Schema
- XML-based alternative to DTD
- more support for data types, written in XML

On the Server
- just text files like HTML
- easily stored / generated by werver
- use PHP to generate XML response
