For current math solving testing & report
- From William: 
https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator this is the python library which has a function to generate example problems of a certain type based on a number which indicates the type of problem
https://staging.mathanswered.com/ enter them here not sure if you have an account for the math site yet but you should make one
theres about a 100 unique types or so listed on the github page, generate atleast one problem of each type and make a report of whether our mathbot can solve it or not
