For current math solving testing & report
- From William: 
https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator this is the python library which has a function to generate example problems of a certain type based on a number which indicates the type of problem
https://staging.mathanswered.com/ enter them here not sure if you have an account for the math site yet but you should make one
theres about a 100 unique types or so listed on the github page, generate atleast one problem of each type and make a report of whether our mathbot can solve it or not
- Links: 
  https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator
  https://staging.mathanswered.com/



Python code for getting all the examples of the problems:
-------------------
import mathgenerator as mg

genList = mg.getGenList()

for i in range(len(genList)):
    problem, solution = mg.genById(i)
    print(str(i) , "-", genList[i][1], "("+genList[i][4]+")")
    print("Problem:", problem)
    print("Solution:", solution)
    print('')
----------------



Matrix symbol doesn't seem to work. ask about that and if something changes,
	reanalyze 46, 17, maybe 43
Not sure what this is: 23
How to do word problems: 52
mathgenerator has stddev and variance swapped: 59
try to understand: 91
solver has wrong answer?: 91
for the area, volume, etc. problems, go back and enter them in with words
	i.e. 'area of circle with radius...'
