To get PAT (Personal Access Token)
- log into github.com
- settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens (PATs)



To clone HE git repo, setup environment, etc.
1. Generate SSH key
  - [ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "keygen on <date> @ <time>"]
  - no passphrase
2. Copy key and add it to gitlab account
  - copy key from Home/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    paste into...
  - Preferences > SSH Keys
3. Test the SSH key
  - [ssh -T gitlab.com]
4. Clone the repository
  - [git clone https://vcs.he.net/math-solver/math-site-solvers-brian.corbett.git --recursive]
  - type in the fingerprint that is displayed
  - [cd math-site-solvers-brian.corbett]
5. Set-up python environment
  - copy 'make-venv.bash' and paste into the repo root directory
  - can be found at https://vcs.he.net/math-solver/math-solver-issues/-/wikis/Solver-Author-Orientation 
  - [bash make-venv.bash venv]
  - [source venv/bin/activate]
  - [export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)]
6. Test environment
  - [cd test]
  - [python -m unittest line_slope_2points_test/line_slope_2points_test.py]
  



For current math solving testing & report
- From William: 
https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator this is the python library which has a function to generate example problems of a certain type based on a number which indicates the type of problem
https://staging.mathanswered.com/ enter them here not sure if you have an account for the math site yet but you should make one
theres about a 100 unique types or so listed on the github page, generate atleast one problem of each type and make a report of whether our mathbot can solve it or not

Python code for getting all the examples of the problems:
-------------------
import mathgenerator as mg

genList = mg.getGenList()

for i in range(len(genList)):
    problem, solution = mg.genById(i)
    print(str(i) , "-", genList[i][1], "("+genList[i][4]+")")
    print("Problem:", problem)
    print("Solution:", solution)
