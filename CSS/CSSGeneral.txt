1. What does 'white-space: nowrap' do?
   - normal | nowrap | pre | pre-line | pre-wrap | initial | inherit
   - 'nowrap': sequences of whitespace collapse into single whitespace
               text never wraps to next line until <br> is encountered
2. What does 'text-indent' do?
   - indents just the FIRST line of a text BLOCK
   - other values can modify this
3. 'background' short-hand?
   - background: bg-color bg-image bg-pos/bg-size bg-repeat bg-origin bg-clip bg-attachment
   - not every value must be used, but this order is W3 standard
4. What are box types of an element, and how are they specified?
   - 2 types of box types, outer display and inner display:
      - outer display types: block, inline, block-inline, etc.
      - inner display types: flex, grid, table, etc.
   - box types are specified by the 'display' property
5. What is the 'clear' property when dealing with other floated elements?
   - none | left | right | both
   - will force element to not be beside a floated element
6. Do pseudo-elements ':first-line' and :'first-letter' apply to both inline and block elements?
   - NO, these two pseudo-elements only apply to block elements
7. Will any of the border properties have any effect is 'border-style' is not set?
   - No, unless border-style is specified, no other border properties will have any effect
8. What is the default value for the 'background-attachment' property?
   - scroll (DEFAULT) | fixed | local
9. When the position property is 'fixed,' what is the element fixed relative to?
   - static (DEFAULT) | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky
      - static:   renders in order of appearance in document flow
		  'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left', & 'z-index' properties have no effect
      - relative: positioned relative to it's normal position of static, but then offset by the use of
                     'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left', 'z-index' 
		  other elements act as if this element is static
      - absolute: element is completely removed from the normal document flow
                  positioned relative to it's closest non-static positioned ancestor, else initial containing block
                  'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left', 'z-index' determine final position
      - fixed:    element is removed from the normal document flow
                  positioned relative to the viewport
		  'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left' determine final position
      - sticky:   position according to normal document flow (static) and offset with 'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left'
                  becomes fixed relative to scrolling ancestor crossing a threshold
10. What is an elements margin specified by percentage relative to?
    - it's containing element
11. What property deals with 'background' and 'border' for empty cells in a table?
    - 'empty-cells'
    - show | hide | initital | inherit
12. What order do the pseudo-classes have to be set in?
    - :link --> :visited --> :hover --> :active
13. How do you calculate the total width of an element?
    - width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border (+ left margin + right margin)

1. background-origin: padding-box | content-box | border-box
   background-clip:   "                "                   "
2. Attribute selector
   - div[title="blue"]  - exactly "blue"
   - div[title|="blue"] - exactly "blue" OR "blue-..."
   - div[title*="blue"] - contains "blue" anywhere
   - div[title~="blue"] - contains "blue" in the list of values
   - div[title^="blue"] - starts with "blue"
   - div[title$="blue"] - ends with "blue"
3. Element selectors
   - div p   - all p descended from a div
   - div > p - all p that are children of a div
   - div + p - all p that are adjacent siblings to div
   - div ~ p - all p that are general sibilings to div
