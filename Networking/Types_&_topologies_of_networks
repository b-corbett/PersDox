Types of networks:
- LAN (Local Area Network) - smallest area
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) - larger area than LAN
- WAN (Wide Area Network) - largest of all
- less known: PAN (Personal Area)    SAN (Storage Area)    EPN (Enterprise Private)    VPN (Virtual Private)

Topologies are the physical layout of a network
- Star - all devices are connected through a hub (central node)
  * total number of links: N
  * total number of ports: N
- Point-to-point - two devices connected directly to each other
- Ring - each device connects to two neighboring device
- Bus - each device connects to a single backbone via drop lines
  * transmits data down the backbone and shoots off into the drop lines to each device
  * total number of links: 1 backbone, N drop lines
- (Daisy) Chain
- Mesh - each device is directly connected to every other device
  * number of ports for each device: (N-1)
  * total number of ports: N*(N-1)
  * total number of links: N(N-1)/2
- Tree
- Hybrid
