Autonomous System (AS) - https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/
  - a large pool of routers (network) run by single organization
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) - https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/
  - data is moved through autonomous systems who will bring the data closer to it's destination
  - the autonomous systems share addresses (prefixes, most likely) with each other
  Hijacking - https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/
    - falsely announcing ownership of IP addresses to reroute traffic to malicious addresses
  Communities - https://networklessons.com/bgp/bgp-communities-explained
    - extra bit of information that is advertised in the prefixes
    - used for things like traffic engineering or dynamic routing policies
  Peering Session (Transit Session - customers) - https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/bgp/topics/topic-map/bgp-peering-sessions.html
    - connection between autonomous systems over BGP to advertise addresses
Cross-connect - https://www.datacenters.com/news/data-center-connectivity-everything-you-need-to-know-about-cross-connects
  - physical direct connection between two different termination locations
  - connect COLOCATION RACK to ISP, telecom carrier, network provider, cloud provider
  - the lines typically run above the colocation racks
Circuit-switched - https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/circuit-switched
  - a connection between end nodes that is dedicated to those nodes for the duration of the connection
  Circuit ID - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_ID
    - company specific identifier for the circuit-switched connection between two nodes
Default route - https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/is-is/topics/concept/default-route-understanding.html
  - when a computer sends data across the internet, the computer will check if it has the IP address in it's cache
  - if it cannot find it, it will send to the default address which will typically be the ISP's address
  local loop
  loopback
Internet Exchange Point (IXP) - https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/internet-exchange-point-ixp/
  - physical location through which internet infrastructure companies such as ISPs and CDNs connect with each other
  - share transit outside of their own network
Prefixes (max prefixes) - https://medium.com/netdevops/what-are-network-prefixes-e1923a1d6a3e
                        - https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-determine-network-prefixes
  - aggregations of IP addresses to create groups

DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack - https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/
  - attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a server/network by overwhelming it with flood of manufactured traffic
DHCP (Dynamic Host Conifguration Protocol) - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/dhcp/dhcp-top
  - client/server protocol that automatically provides an IP host with it's address
