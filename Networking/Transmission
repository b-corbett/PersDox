Transmission media is the physical path between transmitter and receiver
- is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another

Types of transmission media
- Guided media (wired / bounded) - high speed, secure, used for comparatively shorter distances
  * Twisted Pair Cable - most common
    > Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
    > Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
  * Coaxial Cable
  * Optical Fiber Cable
  * Stripline
  * Microstripline
- Unguided media
  * Space
    > Radio waves
    > Microwaves
    > Infrared

Transmission modes
- Simple
  * unidirectional
- Half-duplex
  * bidirectional not simultaneous
- Full-duplex
  * bidirectional simultaneous
