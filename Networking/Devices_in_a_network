There are devices whose job is to help with the communcation between hosts:
- Router (wired/wireless)
  * network layer (3)
  * routes packets based on IP addresses
  * have an updating routing table
  * connect LANs and WANs
- Repeater
  * regenerate the signal over network before signal becomes weak or corrupted to extend length
  * they don't amplify the signal, they recreate bit by bit
  * 2-port device
- Hub
  * basically multi-port repeater
  * no filtering happening, all signals are sent to all connected devices
  * no intelligence
- Bridge (wired/wireless)
  * operates at the data link layer (2)
  * also a repeater, but filters based on MAC addresses of src and dest
  * 2-port device
- Switch
  * operates at data link layer (2)
  * multi-port bridge that can boost efficiency & performance
  * can error check and filter based on MAC address
- Gateway
  * passage to connect two networks, protocol converters
  * operate at any network layer
- Brouter
  * bridge and router combo
  * data link (2) or network layer (3) 
  * router: routes intelligently, bridge: filtering traffic
- NIC (Network Interface Card)
  * connects device to the network
  * unique ID called MAC address
  * data link (2) and physical (1)
