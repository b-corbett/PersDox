- 7 Layer OSI Model
  * 7. Application Layer
  * 6. Presentation Layer
    ~ 
  * 5. Session Layer
    ~ establishment of connection, maintenance of session, authentication, security
  * 4. Transport Layer
    ~ responsible for end-to-end delivery of the complete message
    ~ acknowledges successful transmission or resends if error
  * 3. Network Layer
    ~ works for transmission of data from one host to another in different networks
    ~ IP addresses are used here
  * 2. Data Link Layer
    ~ make sure node-to-node data transfer is error free over the physical layer
    ~ MAC addresses are used here
  * 1. Physical Layer
    ~ physical connections between devices
    ~ transmits bits via cables
- Protocols - set of rules / algorithms define how two entities can communicate
  * Each OSI layer has different protocols defined
    ~ TCP     ~ IP      ~ UDP      ~ ARP      ~ DHCP     ~ FTP
    
- Communication of the unstructured raw data streams over a physical medium
  - Mechanical / electrical aids to maintain and transmit BITS across physical connections
  - Technical Transmission Processes:
    * Electrical signals
    * Optical signals (optical fiber, laser)
    * Electromagnetic waves (wifi)
    * Sound
  - Devices at the physical layer:
    * Hubs, switches, routers, Ethernet
    * Antenna
    * Amplifier
    * Plug and socket
    * Repeater
    * Stroke
    * Transceiver
    * T-bar
    * Terminator
  - Different methods of bit transmission require different methods of encoding bits in a signal
  - Configurations:
    * Point-to-point: link fully dedicated to carry data between two devices  0-----------------------0
    * Multi-point: link through mulitple devices  0----------o<======8=====>o----0-------------0
  - Modes of transmission medium:
    * Simplex: 1 device sends data, 1 device receives data (keyboards, radio/TV broadcasting)
    * Half-duplex: 2 send & receive data, but only one at a time (walkie-talkie)
    * Full-duplex: 2 send & receive data simultaneously (phones, chats)    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    TCP/IP:
- Instead of the 7 layer OSI model, the TCP/IP model is a more concise 4 layers
  * 1. Application layer - application, presentation, session layers of the OSI
    ~ Node-tonode communication and controls user interface specifications
    ~ HTTP / HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
      > manages communications between browsers and servers
      > HTTP-Secure is HTTP combined with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) 
    ~ SSH (Secure Shell)
      > maintains encrypted connections
      > secure session over TCP/IP
    ~ NTP (Network Time Protocol)
      > syncs clocks on all computers
    ~ FTP   ~ TFTP   ~ Telnet   ~ SMTP   ~ SNMP   ~ DNS   ~ DHCP   ~ NFS
  * 2. Transport layer (Host-to-Host) - end-to-end, error-free delivery
    ~ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
      > provides reliable and error-free communication between end systems
      > sequencing and segmentation of data
      > controls flow of data
    ~ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
      > connectionless, "unreliable", just sends it
  * 3. Internet layer - parallels network layer
    ~ logical transmission of data over entire network
    ~ IP (Internet Protocol)
      > delivers packets from source host to destination host by looking at IP addresses in headers
      > IPv4 & IPv6
    ~ ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
      > responsible for providing hosts with info about network problems
    ~ ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
      > finds hardware address (MAC) from a logical address (IP)
  * 4. Network Access layer - physical / data link layer combo
    ~ ARP
