What is a network?
- Interconnection of multiple devices (hosts/nodes) for sending/receiving data
  * Open system: connected to network, ready for communication
  * Closed system: not connected to network, can't be communicated with
- There are devices whose job is to help with the communcation between hosts:
  * Router (wired/wireless)
  * Switch
  * Hub
  * Bridge (wired/wireless)
- Topologies are the physical layout of a network
  * Star - all devices are connected through a hub (central node)
    ~ total number of links: N
    ~ total number of ports: N
  * Point-to-point - two devices connected directly to each other
  * Ring - each device connects to two neighboring device
  * Bus - each device connects to a single backbone via drop lines
    ~ transmits data down the backbone and shoots off into the drop lines to each device
    ~ total number of links: 1 backbone, N drop lines
  * (Daisy) Chain
  * Mesh - each device is directly connected to every other device
    ~ number of ports for each device: (N-1)
    ~ total number of ports: N*(N-1)
    ~ total number of links: N(N-1)/2
  * Tree
  * Hybrid
- 7 Layer OSI Model
  * 7. Application Layer
  * 6. Presentation Layer
    ~ 
  * 5. Session Layer
    ~ establishment of connection, maintenance of session, authentication, security
  * 4. Transport Layer
    ~ responsible for end-to-end delivery of the complete message
    ~ acknowledges successful transmission or resends if error
  * 3. Network Layer
    ~ works for transmission of data from one host to another in different networks
    ~ IP addresses are used here
  * 2. Data Link Layer
    ~ make sure node-to-node data transfer is error free over the physical layer
    ~ MAC addresses are used here
  * 1. Physical Layer
    ~ physical connections between devices
    ~ transmits bits via cables
- Protocols - set of rules / algorithms define how two entities can communicate
  * Each OSI layer has different protocols defined
    ~ TCP     ~ IP      ~ UDP      ~ ARP      ~ DHCP     ~ FTP
- Unique identifiers of a network
  * Hostname - Unique name for each device in a network (cmd: hostname)
  * Internet Protocol (IP) Address - Logical network address for each device (cmd: hostname -I)
    ~ IPv4 - 32-bits  (4-bytes)  = 2^32 addresses available  172.58.4.242
    ~ IPv6 - 128-bits (16-bytes) = 2^128 addresses available 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 or 2001:db8:85a3:::8a2e:370:7334 
  * Media Access Control (MAC) Address - Physical address associated with each devices Network Interface Card (NIC)
    ~ 48-bits (6-bytes) 00:1B:44:11:3A:B7
  * Port - logical channel through data can be sent/received
    ~ Any host may have multiple apps running, each idenitified by the port number on which they are running
    ~ 16-bits (2-bytes) 
      > well known: 0 - 1023
      > registered: 1024 - 49151
      > ephemeral: 49152 - 65535
  * Socket - combination of IP address and Port number 
    ~ IPAddr-A:Port-A
    
Network criteria:
- Performance - measured in terms of
  * Transit time - message travel time beween two devices
  * Response time - time between inquiry and response (round-trip)
- Reliability - measured in terms of
  * Failure frequency
  * Failure recoveries
  * Integrity during catastrophe
- Security
  * Protection from unauthorized access
  
Types of networks:
- LAN (Local Area Network) - smallest area
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) - larger area than LAN
- WAN (Wide Area Network) - largest of all
- less known: PAN (Personal Area)    SAN (Storage Area)    EPN (Enterprise Private)    VPN (Virtual Private)

TCP/IP:
- Instead of the 7 layer OSI model, the TCP/IP model is a more concise 4 layers
  * 1. Application layer
  * 2. Transport layer
  * 3. Internet layer - parallels network layer
  * 4. Network Access layer - physical / data link layer combo
    






















- Communication of the unstructured raw data streams over a physical medium
  - Mechanical / electrical aids to maintain and transmit BITS across physical connections
  - Technical Transmission Processes:
    * Electrical signals
    * Optical signals (optical fiber, laser)
    * Electromagnetic waves (wifi)
    * Sound
  - Devices at the physical layer:
    * Hubs, switches, routers, Ethernet
    * Antenna
    * Amplifier
    * Plug and socket
    * Repeater
    * Stroke
    * Transceiver
    * T-bar
    * Terminator
  - Different methods of bit transmission require different methods of encoding bits in a signal
  - Configurations:
    * Point-to-point: link fully dedicated to carry data between two devices  0-----------------------0
    * Multi-point: link through mulitple devices  0----------o<======8=====>o----0-------------0
  - Modes of transmission medium:
    * Simplex: 1 device sends data, 1 device receives data (keyboards, radio/TV broadcasting)
    * Half-duplex: 2 send & receive data, but only one at a time (walkie-talkie)
    * Full-duplex: 2 send & receive data simultaneously (phones, chats)
